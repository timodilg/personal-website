      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Timo, 28 years old and I just finished the coding bootcamp
        neuefische. My digital journeymanâ€™s piece is a time management mobile
        app which helps you to work more focussed. It is build with the React
        framework. Here you can see it live.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the neuefische bootcamp I learned a lot about the following
        technologies and tools:
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript ES2020, React latest, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Storybook,
        Cypress, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, mongoose, Postman, Shell, npm, Git
        Workflow, Sketch
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently looking for new opportunities in the tech environment. If
        you want to learn more about me I would be happy if we get in touch.
